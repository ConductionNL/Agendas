# About this component

The calendar service aims to provide both calendar and bookings functionality to other common ground applications. As such a Calendar object is always on the inverse side of a relation. E.g. a person, resource or location can have a calendar but a calendar doesn�t have an owner. 
Keeping in form with international standardization calendars are based on the [schema.org]( https://schema.org/) [Schedule](https://schema.org/Schedule) and [Event](https://schema.org/Event) objects. They are however extend with functionality from CalDav[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV), [ICalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) and [Google�s Calendar api](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/php) to provide and complete API experience.
